							<h1>What is <span style = "color: var(--accent)">Poverty?</span></h1>
							<p>The most widely held and understood definition of absolute poverty measures poverty strictly in economic terms &mdash; earning less than $1.90 a day. By this definition, poverty is the condition where a person lacking financial resources is unable to meet a minimum standard of living.
							<br><br>	
							This poverty definition encompasses living conditions, an inability to meet basic needs because food, clean drinking water, proper sanitation, education, health care and other social services are inaccessible.</p>

							<p>The unemployment rate during this pandemic is very high and millions report that their households did not get enough to eat or are not caught up on rent payments.
							<br><br>
							The impacts of the pandemic and the economic fallout have been widespread, but are particularly prevalent among Black, Latino, Native American, and immigrant households. These disproportionate impacts reflect harsh, longstanding inequities &mdash; often stemming from structural racism &mdash; in education, employment, housing, and health care that the current crisis is exacerbating.</p>

							<h1><span style = "color: var(--accent)">Racial Bias</span> in Poverty</h1>
							<p>In 2001 the World Conference against Racism in Durban emphasized that poverty, underdevelopment, marginalization, social exclusion and economic disparities are closely associated with racism, and contribute to the persistence of racist attitudes and practices which in  turn generate more poverty. 
							<li>National studies by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services reported "minority children, and in particular African American children, are more likely to be in foster care placement than receive in-home services, even when they have the same problems and characteristics as white children."</li>
							<li>According to January 2017 reports from the state of Washington, "African American children were 2.2 times and Native American children were 2.9 times more likely to be placed in out-of-home care compared to white children"</li>
							</p>	
							<p>
								These statistics and similar reports from around the country indicate race and poverty-related disparities and disproportionality in the child welfare system. Race and socioeconomic status often impact decisions in every stage of the child welfare system from reporting, to foster care placements, to termination of parental rights decisions.
							</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<p>In many societies, people are prevented from enjoying their rights not just because they cannot afford to do so, but simply because of who they are. Discrimination is often a barrier to essential services for certain groups of people, for example, migrants, ethnic and racial minorities, refugees and internally displaced persons, women, persons living with HIV/AIDS, stateless persons and persons with disabilities. Discriminatory laws, policies and practices may mean that these groups are also denied the right to work, the right to adequate housing and the right to a high standard of health. Racial discrimination and other types of discrimination can have a multiplier effect, compounding social exclusion and, in the worst cases, fuelling violent conflict.</p>
