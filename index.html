						<h1>What is <span style = "color: var(--accent)">Poverty?</span></h1>
						<p>The most widely held and understood definition of absolute poverty measures poverty strictly in economic terms &mdash; earning less than $1.90 a day. By this definition, poverty is the condition where a person lacking financial resources is unable to meet a minimum standard of living.
						<br><br>	
						This poverty definition encompasses living conditions, an inability to meet basic needs because food, clean drinking water, proper sanitation, education, health care and other social services are inaccessible.</p>

						<p>The unemployment rate during this pandemic is very high and millions report that their households did not get enough to eat or are not caught up on rent payments.
						<br><br>
						The impacts of the pandemic and the economic fallout have been widespread, but are particularly prevalent among Black, Latino, Native American, and immigrant households. These disproportionate impacts reflect harsh, longstanding inequities &mdash; often stemming from structural racism &mdash; in education, employment, housing, and health care that the current crisis is exacerbating.</p>
